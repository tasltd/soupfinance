### Call-to-Action Strategy

**Primary CTA Placement:**
- Hero section (above fold) - CRITICAL
- After social proof section
- After features section
- Final section before footer
- Sticky header/floating button (for long pages)

**CTA Button Best Practices:**
- Action-oriented copy ("Start Free Trial", "Get Started", "See Pricing")
- Contrasting color (use primary brand color)
- Large touch target (min 44px height)
- No-risk language ("No credit card required", "Cancel anytime")

**2025 Conversion Data:**
- Pages with 1 primary CTA convert 266% better than multiple competing CTAs
- CTA buttons should be visible within 3 seconds of page load

**Forms:**

- Each additional field = 4-8% conversion drop
- Progressive profiling (ask more later)
- Only capture essential info upfront (email, company name)
