    SoupFinance Logo Mark - Designed with Gemini 3
    Design: Modern "Growth S" Monogram
    Concept: A bold, continuous line forming an 'S' that evokes a ledger entry or financial flow.
    The geometric structure represents stability and precision, while the rounded terminals
    and gradient background suggest modern, accessible financial tech.

    The Mark: A stylized "S" constructed from a single thick path.
    - Stroke width of 7px ensures visibility at 16x16 favicon size.
    - Geometric arcs (A 6 6) create a precise, engineered look (Financial Precision).
    - Open counters ensure the shape doesn't plug up at small sizes.
