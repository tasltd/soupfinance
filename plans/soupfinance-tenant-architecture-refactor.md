# SoupFinance Tenant Architecture Refactor Plan

**Created**: 2026-01-30
**Updated**: 2026-01-30
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Backend & Frontend Registration Complete, Client CRUD Pending
**Priority**: CRITICAL

---

## Architecture Context (CRITICAL)

**SoupFinance follows a Tenant-per-Account architecture:**

Each SoupFinance customer gets their own `Account` (the multi-tenant discriminator domain in soupmarkets-web).

1. **SoupFinance registration creates a NEW Account (tenant)**, not Corporate entities in a shared tenant
2. **Invoice clients are managed via `/rest/invoiceClient/*` endpoints** (NOT `/rest/client/*` which is for investment clients)
3. **Business types**: TRADING (inventory-based, has COGS) and SERVICES (no inventory, labor expenses)
4. **Password is NOT required during registration** - set during email confirmation
5. **Email verification required before login**

---

## Implementation Progress

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Backend: BusinessLicenceCategory | ✅ Complete | Added TRADING, SERVICES |
| Backend: Registration endpoints | ✅ Complete | `/account/register.json`, `/account/confirmEmail.json` |
| Backend: COA seed data | ⚠️ Partial | Seeded at registration (`AccountRegistrationService.createDefaultChartOfAccounts`, 32 SERVICES / 37 TRADING accounts). No system-account flags, no "Other Liabilities" category for the A/P lookup, no tenant-admin apply. See `plans/soupfin-142-coa-seeding-backend.md` (verified 2026-10-10, SOUPFIN-153) |
| Frontend: Registration page | ✅ Complete | Business type selector, no password |
| Frontend: Email confirmation page | ✅ Complete | Password setting after email verification |
| Frontend: Registration API | ✅ Complete | Updated endpoints, deprecated old functions |
| Frontend: Client CRUD | 🔄 Pending | New feature needed for invoice recipients |

**Backend Branch**: `feature/soupfinance-tenant-registration` (in soupmarkets-web worktree)

### Frontend Files Modified (2026-01-30)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `src/api/endpoints/registration.ts` | New tenant registration API, deprecated old functions |
| `src/features/corporate/RegistrationPage.tsx` | Simplified form with business type selector |
| `src/features/auth/ConfirmEmailPage.tsx` | New page for password setting |
| `src/App.tsx` | Added route for `/confirm-email` |

---

## Executive Summary

**ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE**: SoupFinance registration should create **new Tenants** (Accounts) in soupmarkets.com, NOT Corporate entities within a shared TAS tenant.

### Before (INCORRECT - Current Implementation)

```
TAS Tenant (shared)
├── Corporate A (SoupFinance Customer) ─── All data mixed
├── Corporate B (SoupFinance Customer) ─── No isolation
├── Corporate C (SoupFinance Customer) ─── Same database schema
└── (All invoices, bills, ledger mixed together)
```

### After (CORRECT - Target Architecture)

```
SoupFinance Platform (tas.soupmarkets.com)
├── Tenant A (Account) ─── Customer's own tenant
│   ├── Individual Clients (invoice recipients)
│   ├── Corporate Clients (invoice recipients)
│   ├── Invoices (scoped to tenant)
│   ├── Bills (scoped to tenant)
│   └── Ledger (scoped to tenant)
├── Tenant B (Account) ─── Fully isolated
├── Tenant C (Account) ─── Separate data
└── ...
```

---

## Backend Implementation (COMPLETE)

**Branch**: `feature/soupfinance-tenant-registration` (soupmarkets-web worktree)
**Location**: `/home/ddr/Documents/code/soupmarkets/soupmarkets-web-soupfinance-tenant/`

### Files Created/Modified

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `src/main/groovy/soupbroker/BusinessLicenceCategory.groovy` | Added TRADING, SERVICES enums |
| `grails-app/controllers/soupbroker/AccountController.groovy` | Added registration endpoints |
| `grails-app/services/soupbroker/AccountRegistrationService.groovy` | Registration business logic |
| `grails-app/views/accountRegistration/confirmationEmail.gsp` | Email confirmation template |
| `grails-app/views/accountRegistration/welcomeEmail.gsp` | Welcome email template |

### API Endpoints (Implemented)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/account/register.json` | POST | Creates Account + Agent + SbUser (JSON) |
| `/account/confirmEmail.json` | POST | Sets password and enables user |
| `/account/resendConfirmation.json` | POST | Resends confirmation email |
| `/account/confirm` | GET | SSR redirect to frontend with token |

**Note on URL Mappings**: Grails UrlMappings has automatic catch-all routing `"/$controller/$action?/$id?(.$format)?"` so no explicit mapping needed for new controller actions.

### Registration Flow (Implemented)

```
User visits /register (SoupFinance frontend)
    ↓
Enter: Company name, Business type (TRADING/SERVICES), Admin name, Email
(NO password at this step)
    ↓
POST /account/register.json
    ↓
Backend creates:
    1. Account (new tenant) with businessLicenceCategory
    2. SbUser (admin user, DISABLED)
    3. Agent (links user to account)
    4. Default Chart of Accounts (based on businessLicenceCategory)
    ↓
Email confirmation sent with token
    ↓
User clicks link → /confirm-email?token=xxx (SoupFinance frontend)
    ↓
User sets password on confirmation page
    ↓
POST /account/confirmEmail.json with password
    ↓
User enabled + ROLE_ADMIN + ROLE_USER granted
    ↓
Redirect to /login
```

## Key Conceptual Changes

| Concept | OLD (Corporate) | NEW (Tenant/Account) |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Registration creates** | Corporate entity in TAS tenant | New Tenant/Account with admin user |
| **Data isolation** | None (all data shared) | Full (tenant discriminator) |
| **Invoice recipient** | Selects from all Corporates | Creates own Individual/Corporate Clients |
| **KYC requirement** | Full corporate KYC | None (basic client info for invoicing) |
| **Onboarding flow** | 4 steps: Company, Directors, Docs, Status | None (direct to dashboard) |
| **API endpoint** | `/client/register.json` → Corporate | `/account/register.json` → Tenant |
| **Password** | Required on registration | Set during email confirmation |

---

## Invoice Client Model

### Design: Generic Command Object

Invoice recipients (Clients) use a simplified model with basic information. A command object/DTO handles both Individual and Corporate types generically.

```groovy
// Command Object for Client Creation
class InvoiceClientCommand {
    // Type discrimination
    String clientType  // 'INDIVIDUAL' or 'CORPORATE'

    // Common fields (used for both types)
    String name        // Display name (firstName + lastName for individual, companyName for corporate)
    String email       // Required
    String phone       // Optional
    String address     // Optional

    // Individual-specific (optional)
    String firstName
    String lastName

    // Corporate-specific (optional)
    String companyName
    String contactPerson
    String registrationNumber  // Optional
    String taxNumber           // Optional
}
```

### Service Layer

```groovy
class InvoiceClientService {

    def createClient(InvoiceClientCommand cmd) {
        if (cmd.clientType == 'INDIVIDUAL') {
            return createIndividualClient(cmd)
        } else {
            return createCorporateClient(cmd)
        }
    }

    private Individual createIndividualClient(InvoiceClientCommand cmd) {
        // Create Individual with basic info
        new Individual(
            firstName: cmd.firstName,
            lastName: cmd.lastName,
            // Create Client base record with contact info
        )
    }

    private Corporate createCorporateClient(InvoiceClientCommand cmd) {
        // Create Corporate with basic info
        new Corporate(
            name: cmd.companyName,
            // Create Client base record with contact info
        )
    }
}
```

### TypeScript Types (Frontend)

```typescript
// Generic Client DTO for invoice recipients
export interface InvoiceClient {
  id?: string;
  clientType: 'INDIVIDUAL' | 'CORPORATE';

  // Display name (computed from firstName+lastName or companyName)
  name: string;

  // Common fields
  email: string;
  phone?: string;
  address?: string;

  // Individual-specific
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;

  // Corporate-specific
  companyName?: string;
  contactPerson?: string;
  registrationNumber?: string;
  taxNumber?: string;
}
```

## Business Type & Chart of Accounts

### Current BusinessLicenceCategory (Financial Institutions)

```groovy
// src/main/groovy/soupbroker/BusinessLicenceCategory.groovy
enum BusinessLicenceCategory {
    BROKER,         // Retail trade-focused
    ASSET_MANAGER,  // AUM/NAV/fund management-focused
    CUSTODIAN,
    TRUSTEE,
    PRIMARY_DEALER
}
```

### NEW: Add Non-Financial Categories

For SoupFinance (general business accounting), add:

```groovy
enum BusinessLicenceCategory {
    // Financial Institution categories (existing)
    BROKER,
    ASSET_MANAGER,
    CUSTODIAN,
    TRUSTEE,
    PRIMARY_DEALER,

    // Non-Financial Institution categories (NEW for SoupFinance)
    TRADING,    // Trading/retail business - inventory-based
    SERVICES    // Service business - no inventory
}
```

### Chart of Accounts by Business Type
